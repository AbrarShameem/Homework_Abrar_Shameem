<p><font size="20" color="orange">Just as there aren't a whole lot of worthwhile Indian restaurants in the west, there isn't exactly a buttload of Indian joints in New York either. There is however, Slice of India, the Elmhurst based granddaddy of New Yorker Indian restaurants, and
a popular destination for the particular type of Indian food adapted to the Indian palate by generations of Indians. 
Since fans travel from Manhattan and farther to squeeze into the little storefront, Slice of India has branched out with an ornate 120-seat banquet hall and dining for 250 at Sunnyside.
Chef-partner Abrar and team have supplemented the menu's signatures, like deep-fried "lolly pop" chicken, "chilli fish" and "Manchurian Fried Rice", with new additions, some of them (Masala Fries, Chicken Stick) even inspired by the American Diet.
